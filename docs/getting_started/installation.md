# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python >=3.10

## Get Necessary Credentials

> Either JWT or OAuth

```{tab} JWT
Go to https://your-stack.palantirfoundry.com/workspace/settings/tokens and generate a new token.
Copy it for later use in the config.
```

```{tab} OAuth
OAuth credentials, can only be generated on Foundry if you have the necessary privileges.
OAuth credentials consist of a `client_id` and optionally a `client_secret`, keep these ready for the next steps.

## Install the Latest Version of Foundry DevTools

We recommend using a new [conda environment] or [python environment],
after you activated it, just run:

````{tab} pip
```shell
pip install 'foundry-dev-tools'
```
If you want to use everything provided by Foundry DevTools (running transforms locally and the s3 compatible dataset api) you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install 'foundry-dev-tools[full]'
```

````

````{tab} conda
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge foundry-dev-tools
```
````

:::{seealso}
The installation guide for contributors can be found [here](/dev/contribute.md).
:::

## Check Your Installation

With the [`fdt info`](/getting_started/cli.md#the-info-command) command you can check if everything is correctly installed.

## Create a Basic Configuration File

After you've installed foundry-dev-tools successfully, run in a shell `fdt config edit`.
Select the config file you want to edit. You probably want to edit one of the **user** configuration files.

Foundry DevTools CLI [config command](/getting_started/cli.md#the-config-command)

## Credentials Configuration

<!-- includes are for including that part in configuration.md -->
<!-- include -->
````{tab} JWT
The following contents are needed for the JWT authentication:
```toml
[credentials]
domain = "palantir foundry domain"
token_provider.config.jwt = "jwt token you generated"
```
````

`````{tab} OAuth
The following contents are needed for the OAuth authentication.

````{tab} Authorization Code Grant
The client secret is optional with the authorization code grant.

```toml
[credentials]
domain = "<stack>.palantirfoundry.comp"
token_provider.name = "oauth"

[credentials.token_provider.config]
client_id = "client_id"
client_secret = "client_secret" # optional with authorization code grant
```
````

````{tab} Client Credentials Grant
```toml
[credentials]
domain = "palantir foundry domain"
token_provider.name = "oauth"

[credentials.token_provider.config]
client_id = "your client_id"
client_secret = "your client secret" # required with the client credentials grant
grant_type = "client_credentials"
```
````

After setting up the configuration, you can execute the following python one-linter to login using OAuth:

```shell
python -c "from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryContext; ctx = FoundryContext(); print(ctx.multipass.get_user_info())"
```

`````

## PySpark

The python package [PySpark](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/) is an optional dependency of Foundry DevTools.
It is required to run `transforms` and the `CachedFoundryClient`, the PySpark version needs to be at least 3.0.

For PySpark to work, you'll also need to install Java, but PySpark is currently only compatible with Java 8/11/17.

````{tab} pip
If you use `foundry-dev-tools-transforms` to install, it will install the PySpark dependency as well:

```shell
pip install 'foundry-dev-tools-transforms'
```
````
:::{note}
TODO: release conda package for transforms
:::

<!-- ````{tab} conda -->
<!-- ```shell -->
<!-- conda install -c conda-forge 'pyspark>3' 'openjdk==17.*' -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```` -->

Alternative installation methods, or more information on how to get Spark running,
can be found in the [PySpark Documentation] and the [Spark Documentation].
