# Architecture

## How the transforms library that exists on Foundry is stubbed in Foundry DevTools

- Input datasets < 500MB are retrieved with the Foundry Dataproxy File Download API
- Input datasets > 500MB are retrieved as partial subsets with the Foundry Dataproxy SQL API (SELECT \* FROM .. LIMIT
- Both of these limits can be changed with the corresponding config option
  - `transforms_sql_dataset_size_threshold` size in MB, default 500
  - `transforms_sql_sample_row_limit`, default 5000
- Datasets are cached locally in a folder (`~/.foundry-dev-tools/.cache`)
- Datasets are automatically passed to transform functions
- Output datasets can be visualized using IDE or Notebook functionality
- Output dataset files can be stored to a local folder for inspection
- Foundry `transforms` library is stubbed
- Dataset branch is detected automatically from the local git branch

The following sequence diagrams show

a) what happens when the `Input` dataset is already cached.

b) what happens when the `Input` dataset has a new transaction

### Known limitations (Contributions Welcome ðŸ¤—)

- CSV format settings are not taken over from the Foundry Schema. Advised to use datasets in parquet format.
- transforms Output not written back to foundry
- @incremental not implemented
- @configure not implemented
