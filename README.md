# Foundry DevTools

Seamlessly run your Palantir Foundry Repository transforms code and more on your local machine.
Foundry DevTools is a set of useful libraries to interact with the Foundry APIs. There are currently three
high level entrypoints to Foundry DevTools:

- A [transforms](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/transforms-python/transforms-python-api/) implementation

  - An implementation of the Foundry `transforms` package that internally uses the `CachedFoundryClient`.
    This allows you to seamlessly run your Palantir Foundry Code Repository transforms code on your local machine.
    Foundry DevTools does not cover all of Foundry's features, more on this [here](https://emdgroup.github.io/foundry-dev-tools/architecture.html#known-limitations).

- [FoundryRestClient](https://emdgroup.github.io/foundry-dev-tools/FoundryRestClient_usage.html)

  - An API client that contains an opinionated client implementation to some of Foundry's APIs.

  - For example:

    ```python
    from foundry_dev_tools import FoundryRestClient

    # Queries the Foundry SQL Server with spark SQL dialect
    rest_client = FoundryRestClient()
    df = rest_client.query_foundry_sql("SELECT * FROM `/Global/Foundry Training and Resources/Foundry Reference Project/Ontology Project: Aviation/airlines`", branch='master')
    df.shape
    # Out[2]: (17, 10)
    ```

- [FoundryFileSystem](https://emdgroup.github.io/foundry-dev-tools/FoundryFileSystem_usage.html)

  - An implementation of `fsspec` for Foundry. Useful to interact with Foundry from popular data science libraries such as
    `pandas` or `dask`.

  - For example:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    # /Global/Foundry Training and Resources/Foundry Reference Project/Ontology Project: Aviation/airlines
    df = pd.read_parquet("foundry://ri.foundry.main.dataset.5d78f3ae-a588-4fd8-9ba2-66827808c85f")
    df.shape
    # Out[2]: (17, 10)
    ```

## Quickstart

With pip:

```shell
pip install foundry-dev-tools
```

With conda or mamba on the conda-forge channel:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge foundry-dev-tools
```

[Further instructions](https://emdgroup.github.io/foundry-dev-tools/installation.html) can be found in our documentation.

## Why did we build this?

- Local development experience in your favourite IDE (PyCharm, VSCode, ...)
  - Access to modern developer tools and workflows such as pylint, black, isort, pre-commit hooks etc.
- Quicker turnaround time when making changes
  - Debug, change code and run in a matter of seconds instead of minutes
- No accidental or auto commits
  - Keep your git history clean
